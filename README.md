### Ticket #004 – Finance Shared Folder Access

**Requester:** bsuber@domain.local  
**Category:** File Access  
**Priority:** High  

**Problem:**  
User reported being unable to access the shared Finance folder located on the file server.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verified permissions in Active Directory using PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Identity "bsuber" -Properties MemberOf
2. Confirmed user was not a member of the Finance_Users group.

3. Added user to the correct group:
   ```powershell
   Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Finance_Users" -Members "bsuber"
4. Confirmed group update replicated successfully.

Had user log off and back in to reauthenticate group membership.

Resolution:
User regained access to Finance folder. Confirmed with user and documented resolution in Spiceworks.
